Note on Loading Excel Files
In the next lecture, you will learn how to load Excel files in Python with pandas. For this, you need pandas (which you have already installed) and also two other dependencies that pandas needs for opening Excel files. You can install them with pip:

pip3.9 install openpyxl (needed to load Excel .xlsx files)

pip3.9 install xlrd (needed to load Excel old .xls files)
